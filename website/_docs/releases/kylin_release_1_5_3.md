_Tag:_ [kylin-1.5.3](https://github.com/apache/kylin/tree/kylin-1.5.3)

This version includes many bug fixs/enhancements as well as new features; It is backward compatiple with v1.5.2; But after upgrade, you need to update coprocessor, refer to [How to update coprocessor](/docs15/howto/howto_update_coprocessor.html).



### New Feature

* [KYLIN-1478] - TopN measure should support non-dictionary encoding for ultra high cardinality
* [KYLIN-1693] - Support multiple group-by columns for TOP_N meausre
* [KYLIN-1752] - Add an option to fail cube build job when source table is empty
* [KYLIN-1756] - Allow user to run MR jobs against different Hadoop queues



### Bug fix

* [KYLIN-1499] - Couldn't save query, error in backend
* [KYLIN-1568] - Calculate row value buffer size instead of hard coded ROWVALUE_BUFFER_SIZE

* [KYLIN-1787] - Properly deal with limit clause in CubeHBaseEndpointRPC (SELECT * problem)
* [KYLIN-1788] - Allow arbitrary number of mandatory dimensions in one aggregation group
* [KYLIN-1789] - Couldn't use View as Lookup when join type is "inner"

* [KYLIN-1800] - IllegalArgumentExceptio: Too many digits for NumberDictionary: -0.009999999999877218. Expect 19 digits before decimal point at max.
* [KYLIN-1803] - ExtendedColumn Measure Encoding with Non-ascii Characters
* [KYLIN-1811] - Error step may be skipped sometimes when resume a cube job
* [KYLIN-1816] - More than one base KylinConfig exist in spring JVM

* [KYLIN-1838] - Fix sample cube definition
* [KYLIN-1848] - Can't sort cubes by any field in Web UI
* [KYLIN-1862] - "table not found" in "Build Dimension Dictionary" step
* [KYLIN-1879] - RestAPI /api/jobs always returns 0 for exec_start_time and exec_end_time fields
